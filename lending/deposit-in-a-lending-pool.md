# Deposit in a lending pool

Liquidity suppliers take a major role in leNFT. Their assets are used by the protocol to provide loans to NFT holders while also accruing fees by doing so.

When depositing assets into leNFT users receive reserve tokens, a representation of their share in the reserve. These tokens will accrue value whenever a loan is paid and its corresponding interest is deposited in the underlying supply of the reserve.
