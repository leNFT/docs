# Gauges

leNFT's approach to liquidity management uses gauges to optimize the incentives for lending and trading pools.

After you deposit in a pool you will receive an ERC721 (trading pools) or an ERC20 (lending pools) which can then be staked in the pool's gauge for extra LE rewards.

Every pool can have a its own gauge, making it able to direct LE incentives to its own liquidity. Initially these gauges will be created by the dev team, this process will then be replace by a DAO proposal submission and approval vote.
