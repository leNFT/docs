# Vote Lock

Users locking LE will receive vote-escrowed LE (veLE). The longer a user locks their LE, the more veLE they will receive.\
veLE allows users to vote on the incentive levels for each gauge and receive revenue generated by the protocol.

Here's how it works:

1. Users lock their tokens in the voting escrow smart contract, which allows them to then vote towards the desired incentive levels for each gauge and to start accumulate protocol revenue.
2. The smart contract aggregates the locked tokens and determines the overall vote for each gauge.
3. Based on the results of the vote, the protocol adjusts the incentive levels for each gauge accordingly.

Locking tokens will also boost a user's gauge rewards all the way up until 2.5x.
