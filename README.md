# What is leNFT?

Introducing leNFT, a new protocol that aims to revolutionize NFT finance by providing a robust trading liquidity layer fueled by sustainable incentives.

The protocol utilizes an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model based on the lssvm model popularized by sudoswap. This approach aims to provide the most efficient liquidity utilization, resulting in more profits for liquidity providers and better pricing for traders. This makes leNFT an ideal choice for traders looking for low slippage and high capital efficiency.

leNFT also features a vote-gauge system, similar to that of Curve, which incentivizes liquidity providers by distributing LE inflation to LP providers through the use of Gauges. NFT projects are incentivized to lock veLE in order to provide liquidity within their ecosytems.
