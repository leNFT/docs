# What is leNFT?

Introducing leNFT, a new protocol that aims to revolutionize NFT finance by providing a robust liquidity layer fueled by sustainable incentives. In its first version, leNFT targets two NFTfi verticals:  lending and trading.

For trading, the protocol utilizes an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model based on the lssvm model popularized by sudoswap. This approach aims to provide the most efficient liquidity utilization, resulting in more profits for liquidity providers and better pricing for traders. This makes leNFT an ideal choice for traders looking for low slippage and high capital efficiency.

For lending, leNFT employs a peer-to-pool lending architecture that allows NFT holders to access instant liquidity by borrowing against their assets. Liquidity providers can deposit into lending pools and collect rewards originating from the loans' interest payments. This incentivizes liquidity providers to participate in the ecosystem, and the borrowers can access instant liquidity without having to sell their NFTs.

leNFT also features a vote-gauge system, similar to that of Curve, which incentivizes liquidity providers by distributing LE inflation to LP providers through the use of Gauges. NFT projects are incentivized to lock veLE in order to provide liquidity within their ecosytems.
