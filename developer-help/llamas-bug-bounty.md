# Llamas Bug Bounty

To enhance the security and reliability of the leNFT protocol, we've established a bug bounty program specifically for the developers within the llamas community.\
The following table outlines the reward allocation based on the severity of the bug discovered:

| Severity\* | Reward  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Critical   | 900k LE |
| High       | 400k LE |
| Medium     | 150k LE |
| Low        | 50k LE  |

Total Allocation: 1.5M LE

High and Critical severity bugs require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward.\
