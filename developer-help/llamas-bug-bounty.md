# Llamas Bug Bounty

To enhance the security and reliability of the leNFT protocol, we've established a bug bounty program specifically for the developers within the llamas community.\
The codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/leNFT/contracts).\
The following table outlines the reward allocation based on the severity of the bug discovered:

| Severity\* | Reward  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Critical   | 900k LE |
| High       | 400k LE |
| Medium     | 150k LE |
| Low        | 50k LE  |

Total Allocation: 1.5M LE\
High and Critical severity bugs require a PoC and a suggestion for a fix to be eligible for a reward.

Our codebase is extensively documented, adhering to the [NatSpec Format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/natspec-format.html). If you have any questions or require further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask them in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QNpBmMCWmb).
