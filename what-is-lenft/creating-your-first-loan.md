# Creating your first loan

### Before you start

Before creation a loan it's important that you take notice of the risks outlined [here](../fundamentals/risks.md).

Whenever you create a loan in leNFT there is a risk you can lose your NFT. This happens whenever the protocol calculates your debt to be bigger than the maximum collateral permitted for your NFT.\
In order to avoid falling into liquidation territory regularly check your loan's health level by clicking on it on leNFT's main page. If the health level reaches 0 your loan is in risk of liquidation.

### Creating the loan

To create a loan go to leNFT's main page and click on the NFT you want to use as collateral. A page will pop-up asking you to insert your borrow amount. Keep in mind you will need to approve the NFT to be used by the protocol first.
