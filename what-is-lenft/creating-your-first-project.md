# Creating your first loan

### Before you start

Before creating a loan it's important that you take notice of the risks outlined [here](../fundamentals/risks.md).

Whenever you create a loan in leNFT there is a risk you can lose your collateral. This can happen whenever the debt on loan is higher than the maximum loan-to-value permitted for your collateral.\
In order to avoid falling into liquidation territory regularly check your loan's health level. If the health level reaches 0% your loan is at risk of being liquidated.

### Creating the loan

To create a loan go to the [web app](https://lenft.fi/) and select the asset you want to use as collateral. A page will appear asking you to insert the amount you wish to borrow. Keep in mind you will need to approve the NFT asset so it can be used by the protocol.
