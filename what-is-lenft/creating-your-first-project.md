# Creating your first loan

### Before you start

Before creating a loan it's important that you take notice of the risks outlined [here](../fundamentals/risks.md).

Whenever you create a loan in leNFT there is a risk you can lose your NFT. This happens whenever the protocol calculates your debt to be bigger than the maximum collateral permitted for your NFT.\
In order to avoid falling into liquidation territory, regularly check your loan's health level. If the health level reaches 0 your loan is at risk of being liquidated.

### Creating the loan

To create a loan go to leNFT's interface and click on the NFT you want to use as collateral. A page will pop-up asking you to insert the amount you wish to borrow. Keep in mind you will need to approve the NFT so it can be used by the protocol first.
