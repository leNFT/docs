# Vote for a Gauge

Go to [https://lenft.fi/lock/](https://lenft.fi/lock/) and select the lock ID of the lock you want to use to vote. Then, choose the gauge for which you want to vote and use the slider to input the amount of voting power you wish to allocate to that gauge.

You can verify the total voting power this lock is already utilizing under 'Used Voting Power', and the amount of voting power deployed in the selected gauge under 'Selected Gauge'.

To finalize the transaction, click the 'Vote with x%' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

If you wish to decrease the amount of voting power you're using on a certain gauge, simply update your vote with a smaller percentage (or 0% to remove the vote).
