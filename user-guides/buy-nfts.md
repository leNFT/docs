### Market Buy

If you wish to purchase NFTs immediately at the current market price, select the 'Market' option and choose the collection from which you want to buy. You have the option to buy a predetermined number of NFTs or to select specific NFTs you wish to buy. Please note that choosing the number of NFTs to buy will 'sweep' the market, guaranteeing you the lowest price. After selecting your collection and the amount or specific NFTs, you'll be presented with a price quote.\
Click the 'Buy' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to complete the operation.

### LImit Buy

You also have the option to specify a price and an amount, then wait for someone else to fulfill your order. To do this, select the 'Limit' option, choose the amount of NFTs you wish to buy, and determine the price at which you'd like to purchase each NFT. Click the 'Create Buy Order' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to finalize the operation.

Limit buys effectively function as liquidity pairs that perform only buy operations and will be listed on the collection's pool page.
