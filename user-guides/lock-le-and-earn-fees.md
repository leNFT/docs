### Create Lock

Create a new lock by clicking 'New Lock'.\
You will be able to specify an amount of NFTs to lock and set a lock time for your tokens. Your lock weight (which determines the amount of voting power you have to vote for gauges and your stake for fee distribution) grows linearly with the increase in the amount locked and the lock time.

Click on the 'Lock' button and confirm this transction on your wallet to complete the lock operation.
