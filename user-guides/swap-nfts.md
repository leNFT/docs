Select the collection you want to swap from (sell) and the collection you want to swap to (buy). You can swap NFTs within the same collection or between two different collections.

**From** - Selecting an amount will randomly sell that number of NFTs from your wallet. If you choose to select NFTs individually, you can choose specific NFTs to sell.

**To** - If you select an amount, the system will automatically choose the cheapest NFTs available in the pool. However, if you select NFTs individually, you can choose specific NFTs to buy, but this won't guarantee you the lowest possible price.

Upon selection of the desired collection(s) and quantity of NFTs, a quote for your proposed swap will be generated. This quote encapsulates a 'change', representing the price differential between the NFTs you are intending to sell and those you wish to purchase. Should the change yield a positive value, you stand to receive, whereas a negative value would necessitate an additional payment on your part. To finalize the transaction, please click the 'Swap' button and confirm the transaction within your wallet.
