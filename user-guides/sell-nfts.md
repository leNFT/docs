### Market Sell

If you wish to sell your NFTs immediately at the current market price, select the 'Market' option and choose the collection you want to sell. You have the option of selling a predetermined number of random NFTs from your wallet, or you can select the specific NFTs you wish to sell.\
After choosing your collection and the amount or specific NFTs, you'll receive a price quote. To finalize the transaction, click the 'Sell' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Limit Sell

You also have the option to specify a price and amount, then wait for someone else to fulfill your order. To do this, select the 'Limit' option and input the amount of NFTs you wish to sell and the price at which you'd like to sell each one. You have the option of selling a chosen amount of random NFTs from your wallet or selecting specific NFTs to sell. Click the 'Create Sell Order' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to complete the operation.

Limit sells effectively function as liquidity pairs that perform only sell operations and will be listed on the collection's pool page.
