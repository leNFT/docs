# NFT Owners

leNFT provides a unique opportunity for NFT owners to use their assets. By using the protocol's trading and lending pools, NFT holders can trade their assets and borrow money against them, all while enjoying the benefits of robust liquidity and efficient pricing.

For NFT traders, leNFT's AMM model provides an efficient platform for liquidity utilization that enables LPs to generate greater profits and traders to enjoy better pricing. Additionally, NFT holders can use the protocol's peer-to-pool lending architecture to instantly access liquidity by borrowing against the protocol's lending pools.

Furthermore, leNFT's innovative approach to liquidity management uses gauges to incentivize trading pools, enabling NFT owners to earn extra LE rewards by staking their LP tokens in the trading pool's gauge.
