# LE Holders

Holding leNFT tokens provides several benefits to users, including fee-sharing, and voting power.

**Fee-Sharing:** Token holders will earn a share of 100% of fees gathered by the protocol, providing an incentive to hold LE tokens. Fees are generated from trading and lending activities on the protocol, and they will be distributed to liquidity providers, veLE token holders.

**Gauge-Voting Power:** In addition to governance power, leNFT token holders also have voting power. This allows them to vote on gauges and how the LE inflation is distibuted between them.

**Future Governance:** In the future, governance power will shift from the development team to the community. This means that token holders will have the power to shape the direction of the protocol and the ecosystem as a whole.
