# Claim Bribes

The process of claiming bribes is straightforward and can be completed through the lock page. This documentation explains how users can claim bribes after an epoch starts, provided that they have voted for the gauge receiving the bribes.

**In order to claim bribes given to a certain lock by a certain gauge you'd:**

1. Wait for the new epoch to start: Bribes can only be claimed once the new epoch begins. Ensure that you are past the starting time of the new epoch (00:00:00 UTC every Thursday).
2. Ensure you have voted for the bribed gauge: To claim bribes, you must have voted for the gauge that received the bribes during the previous epoch. If you have not voted for the bribed gauge, you will not be eligible to claim the rewards.
3. Access the lock page: Navigate to the lock page on our DeFi protocol's platform. This is where you can manage your locked tokens and claim rewards, including bribes.
4. Find the relevant gauge: On the lock page, selected the lock and the gauge for which you voted in the previous epoch and that has an active bribe.
5.  Claim your bribes: Click the "Claim Bribes" button next to the relevant gauge. The bribes will be distributed to your wallet based on your vote weight in the previous epoch.
