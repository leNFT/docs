# Deposit Liquidity

Lending liquidity depositors take a major role in leNFT. Their assets are used by the protocol to provide loans to NFT holders while also accruing fees by doing so.

When depositing assets into leNFT users receive LP tokens, a representation of their share in the lending pool. These tokens will accrue value whenever a loan is paid and its corresponding interest is deposited in the underlying supply of the pool.

#### How to?

To deposit assets in a pool simply please follow this [link](https://lenft.fi/lendingPools/) and go to the details page of the lending pool you want to the deposit into. You can then click on the "Deposit" button which will will then prompt you to approve, and then deposit your tokens.
