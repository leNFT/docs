# Deposit assets into a reserve

Liquidity suppliers take a major role in leNFT. Their assets are used by the protocol to provide loans to NFT holders while also accruing fees by doing so.

When depositing assets into leNFT users receive reserve tokens, a representation of their share in the reserve. These tokens will accrue value whenever a loan is paid and its corresponding interest is deposited in the underlying supply of the reserve.

#### How to?

To deposit assets in a reserve simply go to the "Supply" page on the leNFT interface and choose the reserve you want to the deposit into. Then click the deposit button, approving your tokens before depositing.
